Northwestern purple -> spotify green -> black background

* Focused on creating a visually pleasing and theme aligned, but still easy to read dashboard 
* Changed the titles to be more specific to the data but still easier to understand, wanted the titles to be accurate but the most simplified they could be
* The goal was to be concise and user friendly
* Ended with choosing titles and colors that we believed told our story best
* Drop down menu allows user to search for a specific date and see what song was top on that day and all of the details the data provides
